I've been building websites since the 90s and coding in WordPress since 2006. Yes, you could call me an old fart and I won't be offended, I built my first site before CSS was invented. I haven't studied computer-science, it was always just a passion and a hobby. I am proud to say I started coding in BASIC on a 80286 machine and I'm still learning, evolving and growing both as a person and as a developer.

**Passionate about Web Accessibility & Sustainability.**

----------------------

On my free time (if you can call it that) I work on my open-source projects and attending the [Deque University](https://dequeuniversity.com/) 'cause I just like learning about Accessibility.

**EDIT, June 2020: Finished the courses, considering going for the IAAP WAS Certification.**

<br>
Born in 1981 in Greece - where I still live, my extra skills include crochet, wood carving, building guitar pedals and dabling with arduinos. Back in the day I studied sound engineering and I can play the guitar & bass. I used to play the clarinet and trumpet but it's been more than 20 years so don't expect a tune.

If you're oldfashioned you can [send me an email](mailto:aristath@gmail.com) though I can't guarantee a prompt response, it's a mess and things tend to get lost there.
